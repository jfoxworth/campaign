    <p>The phrase "affirmative action" is used to desribe any law, policy, or practice that favors one group over another. This could be on the basis of race, gender, sexual identity, or any other facet of a person that is used to create a "protected group." These policies were never agreed to by the American voters. They are unethical, immoral, and in complete opposition to decency and honor.</p>

    <p>No man has the right to place his child ahead of mine for educational opportunities. No man has the right to place himself in front of me for hiring or promotions. None. This is especially true when it is done on the basis of one race being preferable to another.</p>

    <p>When it comes to the equality of our children, we should neither debate nor negotiate. I have made one of the <a href="/Pledge">pillars of my campaign</a> that I will not allow the government to function if the function of the government is to discriminate against our children. These policies must be recognized as the affronts to civil liberty that they represent and be immediately ended.</p>

    <p>Congressman Weber does not address affirmative action in any way. Early in his career, he answered a questionnaire stating that he opposed its usage.</p>
