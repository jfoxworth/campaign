    <p>Before we can discuss what is wrong with the American health care system, we must ensure that the system actually applies to Americans. To do this, we must end the practice of charging taxpayers to pay for the health care of migrants - both legal and illegal. We have a large wave of baby boomers entering the time in their lives when they will need the most care. That care cannot morally be made more expensive now simply to offset the cost of a hospital providing to services to people of other nations.</p>

    <p>How much of a problem is this? In 2006, a Dallas hospital noted that <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/parkland.asp">70% of the women who gave birth in a 3 month span were illegal immigrants</a>.</p>

    <p>Not one penny can go to the care of a citizen of another nation while veterans and senior citizens are either denied care or the cost of their care is increased.</p>

    <p>There is a great deal of discussion concerning the reimportation of medicine from other nations. The real question is why they are so much cheaper if purchased in Mexico? Why does the US government allow US companies to charge its citizens high rates and then sell that same medicine to other nations at drastically lower rates? Isn't that the exact opposite of how governments are supposed to function?</p>

    <p>We do not need a law allowing for reimportation of medicine. We simply need to remove the laws that allow companies to charge the citizens of our nation more than others.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Instead of discussing which party can better facilitate the administration of health care to all of America, we should simply end government's role in health care. This doesn't mean that we end all government programs, but it is not the government's role to decide who gets what health care or what level of taxation the American people will tolerate to provide care for those less fortunate.</p>


    <p>If government has any role in health care, it should be in assuring that procedures and medicines are safe and that there are no artificial limits on hospitals or doctors by organizations such as the AMA.</p>
