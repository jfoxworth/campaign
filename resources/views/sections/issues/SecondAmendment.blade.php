    <p>The second amendment was written into the Constitution to ensure that Americans could defend themselves against both a tyranical government and a common criminal. Any government that seeks to limit that right is exactly the kind that must be defended against.</p>

    <p>Assertions that the founding fathers could not have envisoned a machine gun or a modern assault rifle and therefore did not intend citizens to have access to such things is ludicrous - an assault rifle is much closer to a musket than the internet is to a printing press.</p>

    <p>A concealed carry permit issued in one state must be honored in all states. A man's rights do not end at the state borders.</p>
