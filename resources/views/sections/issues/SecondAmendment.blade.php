    <p>The second amendment was written into the Constitution to ensure that Americans could defend themselves against both a tyranical government and a common criminal. Any government that seeks to limit that right is exactly the kind that must be defended against.</p>

    <p>Assertions that the founding fathers could not have envisoned a machine gun or a modern assault rifle and therefore did not intend citizens to have access to such things is ludicrous - an assault rifle is much closer to a musket than the internet is to a printing press.</p>

        <h3>Oppose TAPS and Red Flag Laws</h3>
    </div>


    <p>I oppose TAPS Legislation to perform threat assessments on Americans and I oppose the possibility of being punished merely for being labeled a "domestic terrorist". My oppose cosponsored the TAPS legislation and introduced penalties for those labeled domestic terrorists.</p>

    <p>I support a national reciprocity law for concealed handgun licenses. I also support constitutional carry - the legal carrying of a handgun, either openly or concealed, without a license or permit.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Congressman Weber voted against a Democratic party bill called the Bipartisan Background Checks Act in 2019. Other than that, there is little that the congressman has stated or done in this area. As stated above, the Congressman co-sponsored TAPS - one of the most dangerous pieces of legislation to be written by a Republican congressman in the last session.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, the congressman teams with Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar to introduce H.R. 4187, the Domestic Terrorism Penalties Act of 2019. This is an equally dangerous piece of legislation that allows the federal government to enact punishments to those labeled as domestic terrorists - that punishment could easily be a surrendering of weapons.</p>

    <p>Joshua Foxworth opposes TAPS and the Domestic Terrorism label.</p>
