    <h2>Equality for the US and its people</h2>
    <span>A discussion on equality in the US and the equality of the US as a nation.</span>
</div>

<div class="container clearfix">
    <div class="col_full">

	    <p>The central premise of this campaign is that the US and its people are treated unequally as a nation and that internally the US itself has become a fundamentally unequal nation. The population of this nation has the right to demand a restoration of equality both for ourselves and for our posterity.</p>

	    <p>This restoration contains three components. The first is and end to mass immigration and a repatriation of all aliens who reside here as a result of illegal entry. The second is an end to the practice of punishing or rewarding people based upon race and/or gender. The third consists of reasserting the rule of law on an unethical congress.</p>

	    <p>These three subjects are introduced here and discussed in detail in their own issues pages. Those pages are accessible through the menu at the top of this page and on the <a href="/issues">main issues page</a>. It should be noted that this restoration requires that no laws be passed or any executive action be issued. The people are simply reasserting their right as a nation and within their nation.</p>

			<h3>US Equality - an end to mass migration</h3>
		</div>

	    <p>The right and nation and a people to control who enters their lands is the most basic aspect of a country, and the primary indicator that they are being invaded. The assertion that some country's can limit immigration and retain their culture while another country must accept all who enter and change from a single culture to a "multi-cultural" nation is the most fundamentally unequal statement a person can make. The US and its people are the equal of all other nations and people and it is time to assert our rights to retain our lands and our culture.</p>

			<h3>Racial Equality - an end to preferences and punishments</h3>
		</div>

	    <p>No man has the right to lay claim to another man's labor. No man has the right to place his child ahead of another man's based upon a condition of birth. No man can be given special rights from the government based upon a condition of birth. To do any of these things is to assert a class of nobility that resides above the remaining US population.</p>

	    <p>At the present time, the US engages in all of these practices in an effort to punish what is commonly referred to as "privilege". This has led to a situation where one man can work his entire life while being force by the state to give a significant portion of his salary to a second man. This second man's son is then placed ahead of the first man's son on the basis that the first man and his son enjoyed some state approved privilege.</p>

	    <p>No people should be subjected to this type of immoral practice - especially in their own lands.</p>

			<h3>Congressional Equality - an end to separate systems</h3>
		</div>

	    <p>While the Congress creates laws that dictate American health care, Congress is allowed to access health care outside of this plan. Congress is also allowed to perform insider trading - a practice that was supposedly outlawed years ago. To restore equality between the people and their elected officials, Congress must be required to follow any plans the pass for the people and they must be held to the same letter of the law.</p>
