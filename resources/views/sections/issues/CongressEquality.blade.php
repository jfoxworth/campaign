    <p>Nothing is in greater opposition to the ethical principles on which this nation was founded than for our lawmakers to create laws to which they themselves are exempt. While I am opposed to the government control of health care, Congress must be covered by any plan they enact.</p>

    <p>In response to widespread reporting of insider trading, Congress enacted the STOCK act in 2012. It was later "fixed" to close loop holes. The truth is that no special law was needed as Congress is not exempt from standard insider trading laws.</p>

    <p>To end the type of corruption that led to the STOCK Act, a new era of congressional oversight is needed. This will include increased scrutiny of the wealth accrued by members of Congress and their families.</p>

    <p>First, the current reports on assets for Congressmen is too vague. Congressional members must be required to report all assets accurate to within 10%. Second, the assets and activity of any family members must also be reported and investigated. Third, an aggressive investigation into the wealth of Congressional leadership must be undertaken. The practice of Congressional representatives becoming millionaires must be ended.</p>
