    <p>Nations are formed by distinct people groups. The structure and character of that government reflects the culture of the people that created it. The presence of significant numbers of different peoples with different cultures changes the character of that nation and has always led to conflict. The US recognizes the right of all other nations to retain their culture. This includes the nations that we invade in response to terrorist attacks and the nations known to have committed crimes against their own people. We must reserve this right for ourselves as well.</p>

    <p>The population of this nation has always been overwhelmingly white and Christian. This culture is one of the most generous and giving the world has ever seen. Our people travel to distant lands to spread the Gospel and to build infrastructure to provide safe water to people they have never met. They adopt and raise the children of other people both outside of our nation and within the minority groups within our nation. It is a culture of small government, freedom, high trust, and low crime.</p>

    <p>The character of our nation and our laws has reflected this culture. The movement of tens of millions of people from other cultures into our lands changes that culture. To assert that the native white population of this country has no right to deny this migration while other nations and peoples retain this right is to assert that our culture is either inferior and worthy of replacement or inherently evil and in need of replacement. Either of those options tells exactly how we will be treated once made into a minority and provides all of the impetus needed to protect ourselves. If being a minority in this country is so bad, how can white people be asked to celebrate becoming a hated minority.</p>

    <p>Our culture has a right to exist. We have a right to self determination. We have a right to deny immigration to any and all people we see fit and to repatriate any who are present as the result of entering illegally. To question these rights is to question our right to equality.</p>

        <h3>Immigration history</h3>

    </div>

    <p>In 1965, the US was 84% white. That same year, Congress passed the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, also known as the Hart-Celler Act. The legislation changed US immigration policy away from focusing on European immigrants and towards others. In discussing the act, Senator Ted Kennedy asserted that "our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. ... Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset." This promise was not honored and millions of both legal and illegal immigrants poured over the border from nations not previously allowed.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Twenty years later, the American people demanded that something be done to end the unprecedented levels of legal and illegal immigration into their country. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, also known as the Simpsonâ€“Mazzoli Act. The act was a "grand bargain" where all illegl aliens currently present in the US were given citizenship with the promise that no more would be allowed to enter and US laws would be enforced.</p>

    <p>This again was another lie to the American people and the borders were left wide open to allow in tens of millions more illegal aliens. Since that time, every American president has campaigned on the promise of ending illegal immigration and every single one has acted in the exact opposite manner once elected.</p>

    <p>The history of the mass immigration of the last 50 years is one of illegal activity, corrupt politicians, and broken promises to the American people. The American people are under no moral nor legal obligation to grant citizenship to anyone who entered under such conditions - quite the opposite.</p>

        <h3>The damage done</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="divider divider-border divider-right notopmargin">
        <i class="icon-flag-alt"></i>
    </div>

    <p>The damage done to the culture has been catastrophic. In recent years, the amount of money sent to Mexico from workers in the US has surpassed the money brought into that country by oil revenue. This loss of financial capital to the US alone should be enough to spur action.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, <a href="https://cis.org/Welfare-Use-Legal-and-Illegal-Immigrant-Households">49% of households headed by legal immigrants</a> used one or more welfare programs in 2012, compared to 30 percent of households headed by natives. Households headed by legal immigrants have higher use rates than native households overall and for cash programs (14 percent vs. 10 percent), food programs (36 percent vs. 22 percent), and Medicaid (39 percent vs. 23 percent). Use of housing programs is similar. In addition to this, illegal immigrant households account for one quarter of all immigrant households accessing one or more welfare programs.</p>

    <p>US tax payers are being forced to pay for their own displacement. These payments to legal and illegal migrants is being carried out while veterans and senior citizens struggle with health, mental health, and financial security.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, the cost to house illegal aliens alone is close to $2 billion - or 1/10 the amount allocated to NASA.</p>

    <p>The cost to our culture has been much higher. Immigrants from nations to our south do not share the views of the native population on firearms, welfare, corruption, age of consent, or the size of government. In the next decade, they will have enough voters in Texas to control state wide elections. This means that the future of the nation will be drastically altered because of people who entered illegally or through direct deception of the American people. The white Christian native population will no longer have the right of self determination. All of this while the nations these migrants came from deny entry to any other people on the basis of the need to retain their culture and their national identity.</p>

    <p>What has happened in the US over the last 50 years is not migration. Migrants are invited and enter legally. This is an invasion.</p>

        <h3>An end to diversity</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="divider divider-border divider-right notopmargin">
        <i class="icon-flag-alt"></i>
    </div>

    <p>The primary argument's for the importation of migrants are that they are economically enriching, and that our culture needs "diversity". The reality is that both legal and illegal migrants use welfare at rates much higher than the native population and are far less educated. They are not a benefit to the social and welfare systems, but rather a drain on those systems.</p>

    <p>This second arguement, the call for "diversity", must be seen for what it is - an assertion of inequality. No city, no neighborhood, and no business is worthy of existing unless it contains fewer white people. We as a people are the only ones that are told that we must accept that our nations are simply better if there are fewer of us. For us to argue against this genocide is to prove the existence of racism and thus the need for diversity.</p>

<!--     <p>Africa is for the Africans, Asia is for the Asians, Central and South American are for the Latinos, but Europe, America and Canada simply must be multicultural. For us to retain our homelands is racist. To imply that any other people group not retain theirs is racist. All of this in the name of diversity, and under the banner that Europeans and Americans have a special debt to the remaining population. A debt that can only be paid by removing our right to self determination.</p>
 -->
    <p>This inequality must be ended.</p>

    <p>To solve this problem, no laws need to be passed as every law needed is already in place, we need only enforce them. These are the same laws that every President since Reagan has pledged to enforce.</p>

    <p>By punishing employers that hire illegal aliens, those people will return home. By refusing welfare to newly arrived and illegal aliens, we will provide more incentive for these people to return home.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, US tax payers cannot be forced to pay for the health care of other people while our own costs are so high. Any person who accesses the health care system - even through an emergency - must have their citizenship status ascertained and held for deportation if merited.</p>

    <p>It is not immoral for us to enforce our laws. It is not unethical for us to assert equality for our people. Any assertion that it is unethical for us to maintain a homogenous nation, but completely acceptable for nations like Japan, China, Israel, Saudia Arabia, Mexico, or any African country to do so, is an assertion that we are a people unworthy of equality. Any representative that works on behalf of the people of other nations to bring them to our lands betrays their oath of office.</p>

    <p>The people of the US have always felt a moral need to give refuge to those in danger. However, there is a drastic moral difference between giving someone refuge from a war and the mass importation of millions of people under the guise of a refugee program.</p>

    <p>The practice of providing permanent resettlement for people fleeing a dangerous situation must end. Those brought here under those conditions must be returned to their native lands once those lands are safe.</p>
