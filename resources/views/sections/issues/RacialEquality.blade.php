    <p>In 1961, President John Kennedy signed an executive order requiring that government employers "not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin" and that the government must "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".</p>

    <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 then contained language prohibiting the discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</p>

    <p>In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed another executive order replacing President Kennedy's and affirming the Federal Government's commitment "to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive, continuing program in each executive department and agency". This protection was extended to women by another executive order in 1967.</p>

    <p>Whatever their original intent, the existence of these laws is now all that is needed to prove the racism and sexism the laws were intended to end. The laws create a legal system that places people at an institutional disadvantage based upon race and gender and provide the moral justification for broader discrimination.  This discrimination ranges from violence in schools and on the streets to the countless numbers of jobs and educational opportunities that some are turned away from in favor of a candidate prefered by the government. They have led to refering to the massive numbers of gang assaults as the "knockout game" and to the covering up of crimes on <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/07/09/bart-withholding-surveillance-videos-of-crime-to-avoid-stereotypes/">mass transit</a> to protect the image of favored groups.</p>

    <p>The longer we allow these laws to perpetuate, the more we weight we give to the argument that the existence of the native population constitutes an evil that requires government intervention. These laws will never end, there will never be enough "equality".</p>

    <p>These laws effectively create a nobility class in America - one that is defined by being the member of a protected class of people. Men and women are given special access to legal protection, special access to education, and preferential treatment in government contracts. No matter how much this class of people benefit from this government preference and no matter how much the other classes are harmed, the children of the preferred class will still be able to claim preferential treatment on the basis that the other children had "privilege".</p>

    <p>To any man that has children, no pain is greater than the realization that another man has the right to place his son ahead of their own. This is especially insulting when that man has already been given preferential hiring; when the other man's son has benefited beyond the capacity of his father's talent and work ethic; and while you were only able to provide your son with what was left after the government has given a portion of your salary to the other man.</p>

    <p>How bad is this preferential treatment? A recent Princeton University study <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html">found</a> that African Americans recieved a 230 point bonus on their SAT scores when considered for admission. Hispanics received a bonus of 185 points. This means that someone who is not a member of the protected class must score a 1230 on their SATs to be considered for admittance at the level of an African American that scores 1000.</p>

    <p>This is a debt paid throughout a person's entire life and then their sons are born into indebtedness. These laws must end.</p>

    <p>Government laws now mandate that a significant percentage of every contract go to minority owned businesses. This is not only an incredibly racist and unethical policy, it has destroyed the ability of large portions of the government to function properly - including the space program.</p>

    <p>There are not enough true minority companies in the space program to meet the legal quotas mandated. This has resulted in the boom of "sub contracting" companies at NASA. These companies are owned by minorities and lay claim to 30% of the salaries of white male engineers. This is despite the fact that those engineers work at NASA buildings and rarely interact with their subcontracting companies. Those engineers cannot be promoted and have no rights. Most end up leaving the space program rather than spending their careers as underpaid temp employees solely to justify racial quotas.</p>

    <p>These requirements must be immediately ended and the companies liquidated to provide reparations to the men whose labor the government stole.</p>

    <p>In an effort to combat racism, laws have been enacted to ensure that any member of the "protected" class is not terminated improperly. This means that a protected person can bring the full weight of the federal government against any privately owned employer even if no evidence of wrongdoing exists. On the other hand, an unprotected person has no legal standing to sue an employer even if there is direct evidence of fraud and even if the employer was a government contractor.</p>

    <p>This is not equality.</p>

    <p>As part of his educational initiative, President Obama <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/rethinking-school-discipline">asserted</a> that punishment differences in schools was not due to difference in behavior amongst the races, but rather due to inherent racism. He enacted policies that prevent African American students from being punished unless a similar number of white students had also been punished.</p>

    <p>These racist and bigoted rules have made our schools much more dangerous and made education almost impossible in some cases.</p>

    <p>In a similar but more insidious manner, many schools have begun to teach our children that they should be ashamed of their race and their heritage - that they should look in the mirror and hate who they are. These are practices that would have been judged as inhumane in even the most Orwellian of times. Students at universities disavow their whiteness, are forced to begin presentations by apologizing to the native Americans for taking their lands, and in one instance at Evergreen college a student yelled out during a meeting that whiteness is the most evil system that ever existed to thunderous applause.</p>

    <p>The federal government must immediately cease funding to and revoke the credentials of any university or grade school that teaches white children to hate themselves.</p>

    <p>In April of 2017, the Huffington Post ran a story written by a South African woman asserting that white males all over the world should be denied the right to vote for at least 20 years. During this time, the remainder of the world could then vote to reallocate resources to themselves and thus confiscate the wealth of all white people in a totally legal and moral manner. The article <a href="http://freebeacon.com/culture/huffpo-retracts-blog-calling-white-men-lose-right-vote-after-realizing-author-doesnt-exist/">was later retracted</a> only when it was discovered that the author has mislead the website about who they were. However, the Huffington Post never denied their view that all white men should be denied the right to vote and should have their wealth and lands confiscated.</p>

    <p>In July of 2017, <a href="https://medusamagazine.com/beyond-pro-choice-the-solution-to-white-supremacy-is-white-abortion">Medusa Magazine</a> ran an article asserting that the moral thing for all white women to do was to abort their babies and assist all non white women in reproducing.</p>

    <p>The complete ending of the white race is being openly discussed as a legitimate course of action. These laws provide the moral validation for these people to assert that an inherent evil exists within our people and their removal is long overdue.</p>
