    <p>Nations are formed by distinct people groups. The structure and character of that government reflects the culture of the people that created it. The presence of different people with different cultures changes the character of that nation and has always led to conflict. The US recognizes the right of all other nations to retain their culture. This includes the nations that we attack in response to terrorist attacks and the nations known to have committed crimes against their own people.</p>
