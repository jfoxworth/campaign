        <h3>Enforce US Immigration Laws</h3>
    </div>

    <p>Legal and illegal immigration are the most important issues in US politics. For decades, the American voters have selected candidates who pledged to end illegal immigration and for decades those promises have gone unfilfilled. Tens of millions of illegal aliens coupled with a similar number of legal migrants has strained our society and infrastructure beyond the breaking point. It is time for our government to begin serving the American people instead of the citizens of other nations.</p>

    <p>I  <a href="/Pledge">have pledged</a> that once elected, I will do everything within my power to prevent the business of the government from going forward if the business of the government is to circumvent the will of the American people. </p>

	<p>The simple fact is that there are more than enough laws in place to prevent any foreign national from coming to the US. These laws are not enforced because the Democratic party views illegal aliens as a future voting block. The Republican party is financially supported by groups that use both legal and illegal aliens as a method to drive down the wages of American workers and reduce the cohesion of our society. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

	<p>We will enforce the laws already in place to fine business owners that employ illegal aliens. We will deny any form of taxpayer assistance to the citizens of other nations. This includes access to government funded education and health care. These two actions will remove the incentives for illegal aliens to remain and most of them will self deport. This will also return the taxpayer money currently being used to educate foreign citizens to its proper role in the education of our own children.</p>

    <p>Nations have borders. If the people of other nations insist that we honor their borders and yet refuse to honor ours, then a physical barrier to prohibit illegal entry is both reasonable and effective. Any politicans that opposes such a barrier for our nation but supports it for other nations is not acting in the best interest of the American people.</p>

    <p>The United States is no longer a frontier nation nor is it too sparsely populated. We are not bound to provide entry and citizenship to anyone who seeks to come here. An alteration of policy from this standpoint is necessary.</p>
