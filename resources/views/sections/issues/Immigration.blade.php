    <p>Legal and illegal immigration are the most important issues in US politics. For decades, the American voters have selected candidates who pledged to end illegal immigration and for decades those promises have gone unfilfilled.</p>

    <p>We often hear politicians say that America's immigration system is "broken". This is a lie. The reality is that the system is simply ignored. Every law needed to maintain our borders is already in place. We need merely enforce them.</p>

    <p>If elected, I will work to ensure that US laws and the will of US citizens is enforced. This is not a negotiations, but rather a simple assertion of the will of the American people. </p>

    <p>Nations have borders. If the people of other nations insist that we honor their borders and yet refuse to honor ours, then a physical barrier to prohibit illegal entry is both reasonable and effective.</p>

    <p>The United States is no longer a frontier nation nor is it too sparsely populated to maintain itself. We are not bound to provide entry and citizenship to anyone who seeks to come here. An alteration of policy from this standpoint is necessary.</p>
