    <p>Our nation has been at war for almost two decades. We have generations of veterans that suffer from long term physical impairments as well as life long emotional damage. Many of these veterans will need financial assistance for the entirety of their lives. Others need an intervention to ensure that their lives ar not ended.</p>

    <p>It is a crime of unspeakable proportions that citizens of other nations receive health care, an education, housing, and other benefits while the men and women that serve this nation are discarded by the political ruling class. As a member of congress, I will not allow one cent of spending to go towards the benefit of citizens of other nations while our own veterans are in need. This not something that should be controversial on any level and any politician that opposes it should be removed from office as they are not acting in the best interest of the nation that they represent.</p>
