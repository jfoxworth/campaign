        <h3>The plan</h3>
    </div>

    <p>This page will not appear on the actual campaign site. It is simply a means of establishing a basic plan and setting reasonable markers for progress. It isn't set in stone, just a starting point.</p>

    <p>The plan has four main steps. The first is to establish footing with social media presence and just to make sure that we aren't in completely over our heads. The second step is to start a series of interviews on friendly media and begin to raise funds. The third step is to push into conservative mainstream media and push fundraising from mainstream sources. The fourth is the final phase of the campaign in Jan, Feb of 2018.</p>

    <p>I do not believe that most people pay attention to primaries at all. Those that do only do so in the days or weeks before the election. The overall strategy is to build the base in preparation for an onslaught attempt in the last few months. I feel like attempting to get attention early will not be enough to force a debate (although it's possible), and that establishing a high burn rate too early will cause the campaign to run out of funds in Jan/Feb.</p>

    <p>The strategy is to position our people so that we can get volunteers and paid staffers that can come do events in February. Give them time to get off of work and help, etc. Let me know if you feel this is a mistake. Obviously, if we take off in funds and polls, we can always add people and resources. I plan to run this like a startup and grab quality people and wait for the right time instead of amassing resources early.</p>

    <p>To this end, the early months will be spent establishing a bank of data on the web so that when people do their research in the days leading up to the election, they will see that we have a heavy presence - which will hopefully translate to a belief that we are a legitimate candidacy.</p>

    <p>We will focus heavily on our target demographic and emphasize getting a high turnout rate from key people. We will not go into poor demographic areas and attempt to convince them to treat us fairly.</p>

        <h3>Phase One - Foothold</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Goals</h4>

    <p>The objective of phase one is to establish a foothold on social media and determine where we stand. How much social media attention can we get? Can we get mainstream people to pay attention at all? Are there any normies that are paying attention and willing to support our views? This will likely be from mid August to mid September.</p>

    <h4>Opposition</h4>

    <p>Congressman Randy Weber isn't as bad as most Republicans on several issues. However, he is really nothing more than a place holder. It appears that he is fine with his grandchildren being a hated minority as long as he is in charge for a while. He has a war chest of over $300,000 to start with, but hasn't faced a coherent opponent - ever.</p>

    <p>Expect the standard party politics and expect corruption and malfeasance from both parties. This is Ron Paul's old district....</p>

    <h4>Strategy</h4>

    <p>The initial phase will be to release a web page with campaign statements and accounts on facebook, twitter, and instagram. What I need help with is pushing that message out. It can simply start with the various alt-right and anti-migration people discussing the campaign. This will give us a good gauge of where we are starting.</p>

    <p>Fundraising isn't that important in this stage, but we should be able to raise some initial funds - a few thousand dollars to get us off the ground.</p>



    <div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
        <h3>Phase Two - Gather a following</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Goals</h4>

    <p>The goal in the second phase is to establish a following that can't be ignored and to begin canvassing the district to start encouraging voters to actually show up in March for the primary. In this phase, we should have enough money for some basic polling and we should be able to break the 10-15% threshold. However, polling isn't something that should concern us except for getting us into a debate.</p>

    <p>The objective is to establish a bank of interviews and articles so that when a potential voter googles my name, they get the sense that the campaign is legitimate, and they have videos to watch that will show my views and what issues I consider to be primary. They should walk away from those videos and from the campaign site with the singular thought that Europeans in America are being treated unequally and that we have the right to demand our own country, to reverse immigration, and to end the corruption of our children into believing that they and their heritage are evil.</p>

    <p>We should also have the funds to set up an office. I will need to set up an official team too. The timeframe for this is Mid September to Mid November.</p>

    <h4>Opposition</h4>

    <p>This is the stage where the media can easily end a campaign. They will be the primary opponents here as the Weber campaign will likely just ignore us.</p>

    <h4>Strategy</h4>

    <p>The goal is to get on friendly internet shows where we know that we will be treated fairly and where the conversation is reasonable and relaxed. These are shows like Stephan Molyneaux, Red Ice Radio, etc. Writing some articles for some of the more mainstream publications would be great too. However, no compromising on the core issues to get this. The regular media is to be shunned at this point and throughout most of the campaign. No interviews, no discussions, no access.</p>



    <div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
        <h3>Phase Three - Canvassing the district</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Goals</h4>

    <p>In this phase, the goal should be to make the general population in the district aware that there is a primary election, aware of who is running, and aware of what is possible. The talking point should be that we have a real chance to end immigration, a real chance to turn the tide, and that they need to make a decision on whether or not they want to maintain any semblance of control over their country, because this is likely their last chance.</p>

    <p>This phase will run from about mid November to the end of January.</p>

    <h4>Opposition</h4>

    <p>If we get this far, the media will likely ignore us as much as possible and I don't expect the Weber people to be any real trouble. They won't attack directly as it will bring too much attention, but they may have friendly bloggers attack. Response to this type of attack is the primary goal of involving national groups with similar interests.</p>

    <h4>Strategy</h4>

    <p>In this phase, we will use both traditional and viral techniques to spread the message. Door to door campaigning, holding up signs near the interstate, social media, etc. The goal should also be to start getting on local AM radio shows and push into the mainstream media. Our target is white people of all ages and genders, and the message should be simple ... fight back. This could be signs with "End Immigration", "End Affirmative Action", etc. Push the message again that we are on the moral high ground in demanding equal access to our home lands and to self determination.</p>

    <p>The hope is to have a few (hopefully paid) organizers that are intelligent and well versed in the subject matter that can lead 3-4 others. Some will hold signs while the main organizers will directly address any inquiries and hand our business cards or something similar with website, etc. While we will have to spend money here, the goal is still to save for the final push.</p>
