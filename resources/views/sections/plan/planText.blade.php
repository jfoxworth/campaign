		<p>This is a basic outline to the process that could be used to force the US government to enforce existing US immigration laws. As you read this, remember the old quote that no plan survives first contact with the enemy. As time passes, I would add compoenents to this plan as needed.</p>

		<p>Movements need 3 things to succeed - clear goals, clear leaders, and a deadline, whether real or artifical. No matter how the plan changes, we must keep the goal clear and ensuret that we do not move from whatever deadline we set. The deadline can be the day that Congress assumes office for that session or shortly thereafter. It cannot move once set.</p>



        <h3>Step 1 : Give me the mandate</h3>

        <p>Obviously, the first part of this plan is to give me this nomination and therefore the mandate to address this issue. Once that election takes place, it will attract media attention as well send shockwaves throughout the party. It will show the party that the rank and file members are serious about the issue of immigration.</p>



        <h3>Step 2 : Gather supporters in the party</h3>

        <p>Immediately after the election, I would ride that shockwave and approach existing congressional members who share the view that immigration laws need to be enforced. Given that this is a core plank in the Republican platform, this should be most Republicans. I would also work to get other America First candidates elected over Democrats or in other primaries.</p>

        <p>While this is happening behind the scenes, I and other Congressmen would work with TV and radio personalities to promote the plan publicly. For at least nine months from my primary until the deadline, those personalities would be rallying the troops to do what is needed.</p>



        <h3>Step 3 : A new contract with America</h3>


        <p>The real question here is what exactly is it that I am asking other congressmen to support and what are those radio and TV personalities telling the grass roots. The answer to that question is this : A new contract with America.</p>


        <p>In 1994, Newt Gingrich went to the American people and offered them a deal - give Republicans control of Congress and they would then carry out certain legislative priorities. We would again approach the American people with four core promises : </p>

        <ul style="margin-left:100px; font-size:1.25em">
        	<li>End illegal immigration</li>
        	<li>Reform the current legal immigration system</li>
        	<li>Balance the budget</li>
        	<li>Reform health care</li>
        </ul>


        <p>The central premise of this plan would be that if they give Republicans back the House and we keep the Senate and White House we would put those promises into effect in the following ways.</p>


        <p>On the deadline what we set (preferably within days of the sessions starting) the House and Senate would introduce concurrent resolutions asserting that the will of the people is that our immigration laws be enforced. President Trump would then act on this to enforce laws that fine employers who hire illegal aliens. With this in place, a few examples could be set and the remainder of the nation would then cease to employ illegal aliens as the risk would be too high. When they cannot get a job, health care, or welfare, they will return home.</p>



        <p>This will be carried out in the first year.</p>


        <p>Within the first six months, the Republican congress will introduce at least three plans to reform health care, three plans to balance the budget, and three plans to reform immigration and we will ask the Democrats to do the same. At the one year mark, we will enact one of those plans for each subject, or a compromise plan for each.</p>


        <p>Our pledge will be one of action that tackles the three largest issues of immigration, the deficit, and health care within a year. The second year of that session would be enacting that plan.</p>




        <h3>Step 4 : Making it happen</h3>


        <p>While we offer this contract with the American people, we will ask them for more than their vote. At the set deadline where the concurrent resolutions are passed through the House and Senate, the Republican Congress will demand action. This action should coordinated with the Trump administration ahead of time. Those Congressmen and Senators will then occupy those legislative buildings until the will of the American people is honored.</p>

        <p>We can wait no longer. The will of the American people with respect to immigration must be heard.</p>

        <p>Part of the message that our supporters on radio and TV would be putting out for months would be an effort to bring as many like minded citizens to Washington as possible. While we occupy that House and Senate buildings, they would peacablhy occupy the streets.</p>




        <h3>The urgency in this cannot be overstated</h3>


        <p>In less than 10 years, Texas will go blue. This will happen purely due to immigration. If we do not act to enforce our laws now, we will likely never get another chance. Whether Trump gets reelected or not, he will be the last Republican president if action is not taken. </p>



        <h3>Addendum : The Law</h3>

        <p>In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Part of this law was fines on employers that hire illegal aliens - U.S. Code § 1324a.Unlawful employment of aliens. This is the law that we are asking to be enforced.</p>





        <h3>Step 5 : E Verify</h3>

        <p>It is possible that along with a concurrent resolution, Congress could also pass a requirement for companies to use the E Verify system to ensure that workers are here legally. If this is the route we choose to take, the deadline may be set a little later to ensuret that the system is functional and sends flags to ICE when a bad social security number is given.</p>

        <p>If E Verify is not part of the initial push, the requirement that it be used should be added at a later date.</p>
