		<p>I was born in raised in Beaumont, Texas where I enjoyed fishing in the Neches River and on Bolivar Penninsula. I attended West Brook Senior High school and graduated in 1994. The son of an electrician, I held a job from the time I turned 16 as a clerk at a grocery story and as a bus boy at a local restaurant.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>On my 18th birthday, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman. I served briefly in the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was then accepted in the Marine Corps Reconnaissance Unit. In addition to the basic schools associated with this unit, I also attented Army Airborne school, S.F. S.E.R.E school, and others.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>When my time in the service was over, I was accepted into the University of Texas at Austin where I studied Aerospace Engineering. Although the GI bill paid for most of the cost of education, I worked several jobs to pay for housing and food. This included night time security at a private dorm, as a life guard, and as a research assistant at a lab. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2003 and a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2005.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>After college, I began work in the space program at the Johnson Space Center. For 3 years, I worked as an operations engineer during the space shuttle program, assisting in systems that inspected that bottom of the shuttle for damage. After that, I spent 18 months designing structural components for the Orion space capsule.</p>

        <p>I then became a tech entrepreneur specializing in web development and 3D programming. I eventually designed a first of its kind collaborative engineering platform.</p>

        <p>My wife and I live in League City, Texas and have 2 sons. We are devout Christians and members of Bay Area Church.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>For decades, I have watched as the Republican party has abandoned every fight it ever pledged to take on - immigration, marriage, life, the budget, health care, ... Now, the Republican party stands ready to abandon what little fight it has left on the first and second amendments.</p>

        <p>The reasons for this are not difficult to understand. The simple fact is that we have not held our elected representatives accountable.</p>

        <p>Our own congressman promised for years to propose health care reform that was "patient centered and doctor approved" only to pretend the subject didn't exist once we gave Republicans the majority.</p>

        <p>Our own congressman says that he opposes illegal immigration, but when pressed on the matter assert that "as a conservative, he does not support a government big enough to deport tens of millions of people."</p>

        <p>That same congressman takes <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00033539&cycle=2018&recs=100&type=I">massive donations from a Pakistani H1B visa lawyer</a> and then <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll437.xml">votes in favor</a> of virtually unlimited H1B Visas from Pakistan and India.</p>

        <p>That same congressman takes massive donations from fisheries in Galveston in exchange for favors concerning commercial fishing.</p>

        <p>That same congressman then tells the voters of his district that nothing can be done to stem the flow of legal and illegal immigrants. For us, there is nothing that can be done but for those that can pay for, there are no limitations.</p>

        <p>That same congressman then <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/50826/texas-lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-bill-combat-molly-prince?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dwbrand&fbclid=IwAR1yC7V_-t5YTkZKN3TvrzXSPOLPQDuWCTllm1kWb0gxRdqLc2WbLy8VV8I">puts forth legislation</a> that would lead to the labeling of those who advocate for the views that he claims to share as "domestic terrorists".</p>

        <p>The question we are presented with is not how we got here. We know what the problem is and how to fix it. We know who to replace.</p>

        <p>The question I am focused on is what I will tell my sons when they ask me how I let their nation fall into such a state of disrepair. Why did I stand by as laws were created to discriminate against them, as representatives opened our borders, as their futures were stolen through debt, and as the party committed to liberty stood by as enemies placed them into bondage.</p>

        <p>The only answer that I can truthfully give them is that this happened because they live in a nation of cowards, and their father is one of them. Since I cannot bear to tell my sons this truth, I have decided to do something about it. I pray that you will join me.</p>
