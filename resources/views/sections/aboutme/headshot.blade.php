		<p>I was born in raised in Beaumont, Texas where I enjoyed fishing in the Neches River and on Bolivar Penninsula. I attended West Brook Senior High school and graduated in 1994. The son of an electrician, I held a job from the time I turned 16 as a clerk at a grocery story or a bus boy at a local restaurant.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>On my 18th birthday, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman. I served briefly in the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was then accepted in the Marine Corps Reconnaissance Unit. In addition to the basic schools associated with this unit, I also attented Army Airborne school, S.F. S.E.R.E school, and others.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>When my time in the service was over, I was accepted into the University of Texas at Austin where I studied Aerospace Engineering. Although the GI bill paid for most of the cost of education, I worked several jobs to pay for housing and food. This included night time security at a private dorm, as a life guard, and as a research assistant at one of UT's labs where I wrote software. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2003 and a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2005.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>After college, I began work in the space program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. For 3 years, I worked as an operations engineer during the space shuttle program, assisting in systems that inspected that bottom of the shuttle for damage. After that, I spent 18 months designing structural components for the Orion space capsule.</p>

        <p>After this time, I began to work on internet startups and have launched a product called <a href="http://www.cadwolf.com">CADWOLF</a>. This system is a first of its kind engineering platform that links the mathetics of component design to CAD. It is my hope that this platform will radically alter the practice of engineering.</p>

        <p>My wife and I live in League City, Texas and have 2 sons. We are devout Christians and members of Bay Area Church.</p>
