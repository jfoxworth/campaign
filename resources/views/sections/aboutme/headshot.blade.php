		<p>I was born in raised in Beaumont, Texas where I enjoyed fishing in the Neches River and on Bolivar Penninsula. I attended West Brook Senior High school and graduated in 1994. The son of an electrician, I held a job from the time I turned 16 as a clerk at a grocery story or a bus boy at a local restaurant.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>On my 18th birthday, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman. I served briefly in the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was then accepted in the Marine Corps Reconnaissance Unit. In addition to the basic schools associated with this unit, I also attented Army Airborne school, S.F. S.E.R.E school, and others.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>When my time in the service was over, I was accepted into the University of Texas at Austin where I studied Aerospace Engineering. Although the GI bill paid for most of the cost of education, I worked several jobs to pay for housing and food. This included night time security at a private dorm, as a life guard, and as a research assistant at one of UT's labs where I wrote software. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2003 and a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2005.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>After college, I began work in the space program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. For 3 years, I worked as an operations engineer during the space shuttle program, assisting in systems that inspected that bottom of the shuttle for damage. After that, I spent 18 months designing structural components for the Orion space capsule.</p>

        <p>After this time, I became a tech entrepreneur specializing in web development and 3D programming. I eventually designed a first of its kind collaborative engineering platform.</p>

        <p>My wife and I live in League City, Texas and have 2 sons. We are devout Christians and members of Bay Area Church.</p>

        <div class="divider divider-short divider-rounded divider-center"><i class="bgcolor icon-star"></i></div>

        <p>For decades, I have watched as the Republican party and conservatives in general have given up on fight after fight. Whether its immigration, marriage, life, the budget deficit, or any other issue, Republican candidates often promise a lot but never deliver. I have seen Republicans pledge to reign in the budget, only to see their spending increase once in office. I have seen promises of walls, of immigration enforcement, and of health care reform that never materialize once in office.</p>

        <p>There are always excuses as to why the Republicans cannot stop the liberal angenda and always excuses as to why they can't advance their own.</p>

        <p>Eventually, I approaced Congressman Weber's office in an effort to see why he wasn't pushing for immigration enforcement. After dozens of visits, Congressman Weber's office informed me that "as a conservative, Congressman Weber would not support a government large enough to deport tens of millions of people." This answer left me dumbfounded.</p>

        <p>Months later, I saw Congressman Webers vote in favor of the Orwellian named <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll437.xml">Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019</a> which will bring in an almost unlimited number of foreign H1B workers to drive down tech wages. Coupling this with the fact that <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00033539&cycle=2018&recs=100&type=I">one of Congressman Weber's primary donors</a> was a Pakistani H1B imigration lawyer named Azhar Chaudhary and it became obvious as to why the Republicans are giving lip service to closing the borders but are really keeping the borders wide open for both legal and illegal immigration. Money.</p>

        <p>It should be clear to all parties that decisive action is needed to stem the unprecendented numbers of legal and illegal immigrants and that Congressman Weber is actually voting in favor of increased numbers of permanent immigrants. We need a new vision of the Republican party and people with the will to act on that vision.</p>
