						<h4>Enforce Immigration Laws</h4>
						<p>A nation is not valid if its laws can be ignored and its borders are irrelavant. The immediate and unconditional enforcement of valid US immigration is one of two primary components of my campaign. <a href="/Issues">(All Issues)</a></p>

					<div class="col_one_third">
						<h4>End Affirmative Action</h4>
						<p>Recognizing the laws and policies collectively known as "affirmative action" as the violation of civil rights that they represent and then immediately ending those policies is the second component. <a href="/Issues">(All Issues)</a></p>

					<div class="col_one_third col_last">
						<h4>Restore the Nation</h4>
						<p>With these two planks in place, I will work to ensure that first amendment rights are enforced on the internet, that we do not waiver on the second amendment, and that we begin the work to restore the fourth amendment. <a href="/Issues">(All Issues)</a></p>
