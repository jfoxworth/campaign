	    <h2>My Pledge</h2>
	    
	    <span>Most politicians work to keep their messages as vague as possible so that they can't be held accountable for the promises that they make while campaigning. My pledge to the constituents of congressional district 14 is that I will not allow the nation to carry out its business if the business if this nation is to circumvent the will of the citizens and subjugate our children.</span>
	
		<span>Whether it's immigration, the budget, life, marriage, or health care. No matter the issue, "conservatism" in America has become synonomous with "lose with dignity." I will break from this pattern. On the day that I am sworn in, I will lead a nation wide movement to enforce our immigration laws and end affrimative action.</span>
