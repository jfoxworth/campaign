	    <span><p>Most politicians work to keep their messages as vague as possible so that they can't be held accountable for the promises that they make while campaigning. My pledge to the constituents of congressional district 14 is that I will not allow the nation to carry out its business if the business if this nation is to circumvent the will of the citizens and allow our children to be discrimated against.</p>

	    <p>The laws of the nation will be enforced and all people will be treated equally under the law.</p>

	    <p>No excuses. No compromises</p>
